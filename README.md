## Instructions 

- note the `images` sub-folder
- add the `images/zoo-logo.jpg` logo image to the top of each `html` page.  
- setup this logo image to link (`<a>`) to the `index.html` page; structure that image and link as `<header>`
- add the `images/downtown-ithaca.jpg` image to the `About the Zoo` section of the `index.html` page
